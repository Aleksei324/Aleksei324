### Hi there

I'm just a guy who likes to develop software and webapps, play games and listen to music; I like to tinker with *Linux* and open source in general. I can speak Spanish and English.

I'm currently learning about *Vite* and I'll be working on my personal webpage; my favourite language at the moment is *Python*. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk, collaborate or correct me on something.
