### Hi there

I'm just a guy who likes to develop software, to play videogames, to draw and listen to music; I speak Spanish and English.

I'm currently learning about *Go* (maybe *Rust, Elixir* or *Ruby* next) and I'll be focusing a lot about learning cybersecurity; my favourite language at the moment is *Go*. Feel free to contact me if you want to talk, collaborate or correct me on something.
