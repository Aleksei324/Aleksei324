### Hi there

I'm just a guy who likes to develop software and webpages, play games and play bass a little; I like to tinker with *Linux* and open source in general, and I'm changing distros a lot. I would like to collaborate on open source projects.

I'm currently learning *Flutter* and I'm interested about *Rust*; I'll be working on *Numfinity* and my personal webpage. My favourite language right now is *Python*.

**I have knowledge in technologies like:**
- Python
- Java
- React
- SQL

Currently using *Visual Studio Codium*.

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk, collaborate or correct me on something.
